										<h2>The Purpose of a Software Engineer</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Let&#39s start with a general definition of what a software engineer is. As per 
											<a href="https://www.computerscience.org/careers/software-engineer/" target="_blank">computerscience.org</a>: 
											"Software engineers design and develop computer programs and applications." Software engineers often work
										    with system programmers, analysts, and other engineers to design systems, project capabilities, and determine
											performance interfaces.
										</p>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											The general responsibility that lie with a software engineer include:
										</p>
										<p align="left" style="margin-left:40px;color:#545557;">
											1. Designing and maintaining software systems<br>
											2. Evaluating and testing new software programs<br>
											3. Writing and testing code<br>
											4. Produce specifications and determine operational feasibility<br>
										</p><br>

										<h2>How Software Engineering Works</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											The general concept of how data engineering works is to take data from a source 
											move it to a destination for analysis. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWru-b6m030&t=2s&ab_channel=AltexSoft" target="_blank">AltexSoft</a> 
											has an in-depth explanation as to how data engineers work. <br><br>

											To break down how data engineering works, we will start with an example. 
											On a typical team you can have a data scientist, an analyst, perhaps a marketing 
											specialist, and a project manager. Currently, the analyst is doing a lot of heavy 
											lifting by manually moving the datasets into Excel to create spreadsheets and 
											dashboards. When a data set is small, this is not a huge inconvenience. 
											However, as we add additional data to be examined it becomes more of a nuisance 
											to manually move data from different sources. The automation of moving data from 
											one source to another is where data engineering begins. <br><br>

											This automation is called a pipeline. The most common format you will find is an 
											<strong>E</strong>xtract <strong>T</strong>ransform <strong>E</strong>oad (<strong>ETL</strong>) 
											pipeline. Generally, the <strong>extraction</strong> is through an API connection. Once the data is extracted, 
											you can begin <strong>transforming</strong> it to meet business needs. Now that the data is validated and 
											formatted correctly, we can <strong>load</strong> it into a database.<br><br>
											<a href="#" class="image featured">
												<img src="images/etl_pipeline_diagram.png" alt="" />
											</a>

											Another process data engineers must be comfortable with is data warehousing. This is the place 
											that all the central data is stored and organized. Now, this warehouse concept just sounds 
											like a database. However, the purpose of a warehouse is that it will be optimized to run 
											complex analytical queries as opposed to simple transactional queries like a database would. <br><br>

											Data engineers also often work closely with data scientist. When a request to a data scientist 
											has been made to predict a future outcome, it becomes the responsibility of the data engineer 
											to create a custom pipeline for the scientist. A custom pipeline is often needed as the 
											request is usually a one-off task.
										</p><br><br>

										<h2>Exercise: What is a Data Engineer?</h2>
										<p align="left" style="color:#545557;">
											Find a place you will be keeping track of all your work. In that area, please save all 
											the work you do during this internship for future reference. Some examples that have 
											been used in the past are <a href="https://miro.com/signup/" target="_blank">Miro</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, and <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
											In a paragraph or two describe what the purpose is of a data engineer and create a diagram demonstrating their workflow.
